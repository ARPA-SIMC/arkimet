Packaging files for Fedora

(add files in the matching rpmbuild subdirectories)

Please note:

- the spec file might not match the current trunk version, check the Release version (it matches the svn revision of the source code)
- the init scripts are based on the old System V runlevels, a rewrite for Systemd would be nice
