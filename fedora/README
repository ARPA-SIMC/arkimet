Packaging files for Fedora

(add files in the matching rpmbuild subdirectories)

Please note:

- the spec file might not match the current version, it is intended as a starting point for rpm packaging
- the "Requires" section includes dependencies for a full-feature version of arkimet, it's possible to tailor dependecies suiting different operational needs
- the init scripts are based on the old System V runlevels, a rewrite for Systemd would be nice
