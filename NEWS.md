* reftime match expressions using repeating intervals (like `reftime:=yesterday
  %3h`) now have a new `@hh:mm:ss` syntax to explicitly reference the starting
  point of the repetitions. For example, `arki-dump --query 'reftime:=2020-01-01 20:30%8h'`
  yields `reftime:>=2020-01-01 20:30:00,<2020-01-01 20:31:00,@04:30:00%8h`,
  meaning a match in that interval and at 20:30 every 8 hours.

# New in version 1.4

 * Better HTTP code handling
 * Added documentation for datasets, segments, checks, fixes and repacks
 * Fixed some inconsistencies in `arki-check` behaviour
 * Test code refactoring
 * Added local arki-server for test suite
 * Other minor bug fixes

# New in version 1.1

 * New dataset format with no dataset-wide index, and one .sqlite index per segment.
   The configuration required is:
   `type = iseg`
   `format = grib|bufr|vm2|odimh5`
   (in order to be able to enumerate the segments of the right kind, they need to 
   be told explicitly what data format they are going to store)

# New in version 1.0

 *  Removed dependency on libwibble

 *  Minimal python3 bindings, and arki-server rewritten in python

 *  Added `arki-server --journald` to format output messages so that they can be
    interpreted by journald

 *  Added `arki-server --perflog` to log json info records for each query

 *  Implemented sharded datasets: in a dataset configuration, use
    `shard=yearly`, `shard=monthly`, or `shard=weekly`, to have the dataset
    create subdatasets where data will be saved. Locking will only happen at
    the subdataset level.

    There is no automatic conversion from a non-sharded to a sharded dataset.

 *  Implemented `arki-check --unarchive=segment`, to move a segment from
    `.archives/last` back to the main dataset.

 *  Implemented `arki-check --state` to show the computed state of each segment
    in a dataset.

 *  Implemented `--copyok` and `--copyko` options for `arki-scan` to copy
    somewhere every successfully imported (or failed) single message (i.e. a
    single grib in a multiple grib input file)

 *  Removed arki-check --scantest

 *  Simple and ondisk2 datasets now can only contain segments matching the
    dataset step. arki-check will give errors if it finds data files with a name
    that does not fit in the dataset.
    
    Archived data is not affected by this change.
 
 *  Data scanning now only uses "grib" as a format for all grib editions,
    dropping the previous "grib1"/"grib2" distinction.
     
    This has the effect that newly created segments in datasets will have a
    .grib extension where previously they would have had a .grib1 or .grib2
    extension. Existing segments are still supported.

 *  AssignedDataset will not appear among new metadata anymore.
