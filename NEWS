New in version 1.0

 - Removed arki-check --scantest

 - Simple and ondisk2 datasets now can only contain segments matching the
   dataset step. arki-check will give errors if it finds data files with a name
   that does not fit in the dataset.

   Archived data is not affected by this change.

 - Data scanning now only uses "grib" as a format for all grib editions,
   dropping the previous "grib1"/"grib2" distinction.
   
   This has the effect that newly created segments in datasets will have a
   .grib extension where previously they would have had a .grib1 or .grib2
   extension. Existing segments are still supported.

 - AssignedDataset will not appear among new metadata anymore.
