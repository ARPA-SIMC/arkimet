Incompatible changes between 0.1 and 0.2

 - the metadata file is called datetime.format.metadata instead of
   datetime.metadata: the datasets need to be regenerated using 
   ??? (the tool needs to be written)
 
 - the summary file format has changed, they need to be regenerated as well (it
   will be covered by the procedure above, however)

 - the introduction of (??? tool to produce are abounding boxes) may show that
   previously mined metadata for areas is incomplete, and requre changing the
   scan configuration files and therefore a dataset rebuild (covered by the
   procedure above, too)

While we upgrade:
 - implement one summary per file
 - implement the area interpreter, so we can check that the arki-scan-grib
   conffiles are giving us enough info; otherwise, we regenerate the datasets
   for that, too
