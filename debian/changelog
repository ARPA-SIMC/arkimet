arkimet (0.36-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Reduced memory usage when handling summaries, by reusing metadata Item
    objects as much as possible
  * When making big queries, use a temporary file on disk to store data coming
    out of the database, to avoid using too much RAM
  * Avoid several encode/decode cycles for the notes

arkimet (0.33-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Scanned areas are now in millionth of a degree. Beware with existing
    dataset filters.
  * UTM areas hacked into latlon grids are now detected and their area marked

  * Only allow use of a postprocessor if listed in "postprocess=" directive in
    dataset config

 -- Enrico Zini <enrico@debian.org>  Tue, 23 Feb 2010 15:11:15 +0000

arkimet (0.28-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

 -- Enrico Zini <enrico@debian.org>  Sat, 26 Sep 2009 14:30:11 +0100

arkimet (0.27-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Fixed codec for floats and doubles
  * Encoding now mostly works by appending to a single string, instead of
    creating many strings, which should improve performance
  * Get rid of oldsummary and arki-sbenchmark
  * Sorting, if requested is now done server-side and before preprocessing
  * Removed several unused arki-* utilities (arki-summarise, arki-grep,
    arki-scan-grib, arki-dispatch, arki-sort)
  * Reorganised arki-dump as a simple dump to/from yaml
  * Reorganised arki-scan and arki-check to simplify their code and clear up
    some inconsistencies in some command line option combinations. Some
    behaviour may change. One behaviour changes: arki-scan --verbose becomes
    arki-scan --status
  * arki-dump --query
  * arki-server can now expand a query with /qexpand
  * Send queries to the server with the aliases expanded, but first validate
    the query against each server to see if the alias expansions would match

  * conf/scan-grib1: properly scan layers

arkimet (0.25-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Use nag module to report validation issues details in arki-check
    --accurate
  * Removed --salvage backwards compatibility option
  * Correctly handle dataset data files that grow past 2**31 bytes.
    Note: this changes the structure of indices and binary metadata, existing
    metadata and summary files need to be regenerated
  * Use new varint encoding for several bits of binary metadata
    (took advantage of the opportunity since the format has changed)

 -- Enrico Zini <enrico@debian.org>  Tue, 25 Aug 2009 22:44:06 +0100

arkimet (0.24-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Allow to access grib values as gribl.val, gribs.val and gribd.val, because
    grib_api can give different values depending on how it is queried
  * Force some types when scanning gribs, because grib_api 1.8.0 defaults to
    presenting some (like centre) as strings instead of numbers
  * Put yearly files in subdirectories, so that, like with all others,
    maintenance can ignore data files in the dataset root dir
  * ondisk2 check: detect files with out of order data that have been
    truncated
  * Removed code for automatic deletion of old data from the archives. Data
    files can now only be removed from the archives manually
  * Since there are no automatic archive deletions anymore, archive check now
    acts the same as archive repack
  * Store relative pathnames in .archive/ .metadata files
  * During repack, check for consistency of the data that's moved around
  * arki-mergeconf: only scan directories contaning config files
  * arki-check: -s is not needed anymore. It now interrupts checking if
    salvaging is needed, as salvaging was wrong anyway since it picked a
    random item to remove.
  * arki-check: implemented --accurate

 -- Enrico Zini <enrico@debian.org>  Mon, 24 Aug 2009 16:27:32 +0100

  * ondisk2 "archive age": archival after a given age
  * ondisk2 "delete age": deletion after a given age
  * signal aware --data output also for ondisk1
  * ondisk2: if a problem is found during check or repack, disallow repack
    until a check is made, to avoid accidentally deleting files to be
    reindexed
  * ondisk2: new summary cache and more sqlite3-friendly queries, for
    performance speedups during queries
  * print timing information in arki-scan --verbose

 -- Enrico Zini <enrico@debian.org>  Sun, 19 Jul 2009 17:21:06 +0100

arkimet (0.21-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

    not the first
  * Cleanup unused entries of accessory tables before vacuum
  * Delete existing .metadata files after repacking ondisk2 datafiles
  * Block SIGTERM and SIGINT when outputting one item of data, so that
    interrupting arki-query with ^C does not give a truncated output file
  * Implemented "delete age" on ondisk2 datasets (files will be deleted on
    repack)
