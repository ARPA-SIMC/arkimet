``ondisk2`` dataset format
==========================

**note**: this dataset is deprecated in favour of ``iseg`` datasets. If you
have a reason to prefer it to ``iseg``, please contribute it to the discussion
at https://github.com/ARPA-SIMC/arkimet/issues/185. Otherwise, please use
``iseg`` datasets instead.

This dataset contains segments (see :ref:`segments`) with a global index of
each datum in the dataset.

It can enforce detection of duplicates, enforcing uniqueness on the set of
metadata selected with the ``unique`` configuration keyword.

It can optimize queries that use metadata selected with the ``index``
configuration keyword.


Dataset layout
--------------

At the root of the dataset there is an ``index.sqlite`` file that maps each datum
to its segment, offset and metadata.

The ``.sqlite`` file contains additional indices for the metadata listed in the
``unique`` configuration value, to do quick duplicate detection, and extra
indices for the metadata listed in the ``index`` configuration value.


General check and repack notes
------------------------------

The index is not able to distinguish between segments that have been fully
deleted, and segments that have never been indexed.

To prevent a scenario where deletion of the index followed by a repack would
consider all segments in the dataset as containing deleted data, and therefore
delete them all from disk, when arkimet notices that ``index.sqlite`` is missing,
it creates a ``needs-check-do-not-pack`` file at the root of the dataset.

When ``needs-check-do-not-pack`` is present, data files not known by the index
are marked for rescanning (``[unaligned]``) instead of for deletion (``[deleted]``).

The ``needs-check-do-not-pack`` file is removed by a successful ``check``
operation. ``repack`` refuses to run if ``needs-check-do-not-pack`` is present.
This is intended to ensure that no repack is run until the index is rebuilt
with a full check and rescan of all the data in the dataset.
