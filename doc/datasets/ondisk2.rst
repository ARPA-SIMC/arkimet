``ondisk2`` dataset format
==========================

This dataset format has been discontinued in favour of ``type=iseg``.

We are not aware of any production datasets still existing in ``ondisk2``
format. If any is found, they can be converted by changing their type in their
configuration, removing the index, and running arki-check -f to cause segments
to be reindexed.
