# simple datasets

This dataset contains [segments](segments.md) with minimal indexing.

It is useful for long-term storageÂ of data, due to the small metadata overhead
and simple structure.

The only query optimization it supports is when querying by a restricted
date-time range.

Because of the lack of a detailed index, `simple` dataset cannot efficiently
detect duplicate data on import, therefore that feature is not implemented.

## Dataset layout

At the root of the dataset there is a `MANIFEST` file that lists the segments
known to the dataset, together with their reference time spans. The MANIFEST
file can be encoded in plain text or in a `.sqlite` database.

For each segment there is an associated `.metadata` file that contains metadata
for all data in the segment. This makes it possible to select data according to
a query, without needing to rescan it every time.

For each segment there is also an associated `.summary` file, that contains a
summary of the data within the segment. This is intended to quickly filter out
segments during a query without needing to scan through all the `.metadata`
file contents, and to support summary queries by merging existing summaries
instead of recomputing them for all data queried.

## Check and repack on concat segments

### During check

- the segment must exist [deleted]
- all data known by the index for this segment must be present on disk [unaligned]
- no pair of (offset, size) data spans from the index can overlap [unaligned]
- data must start at the beginning of the segment [dirty]
- there must be no gaps between data in the segment [dirty]
- data must end at the end of the segment [dirty]
- find data files now known by the index [new]
- find segments that can only contain data older than `archive age` days [archive_age]
- find segments that can only contain data older than `delete age` days [delete_age]
- the segment name must represent an interval matching the dataset step
  (FIXME: should this be disabled for archives, to deal with datasets that had
  a change of step in their lifetime?) [corrupted]
- the segment must be a file
- data on disk must match the order of data used by queries [dirty]
- `.metadata` file must not be empty [unaligned]
- `.metadata` file must not be older than the data [unaligned]
- `.summary` file must not be older than the `.metadata` file [unaligned]
- `MANIFEST` file must not be older than the `.metadata` file [unaligned]
- metadata in the `.metadata` file must contain reference time elements [corrupted]
- the span of reference times in each segment must fit inside the interval
  implied by the segment file name (FIXME: should this be disabled for
  archives, to deal with datasets that had a change of step in their lifetime?) [corrupted]

### During --accurate check

- format-specific consistency checks on the content of each file must pass [unaligned]

### During fix

- [new] segments are imported in-place
- [unaligned] segments are reimported in-place
- [dirty] segments are not touched
- [deleted] segments are removed from the index
- [archive age] segments are not touched
- [delete age] segments are not touched

### During repack

- [new] segments are deleted
- [unaligned] segments are not touched
- [dirty] segments are rewritten to be without holes and have data in the right order.
  In concat segments, this is done to guarantee linear disk access when
  data are queried in the default sorting order. In dir segments, this
  is done to avoid sequence numbers growing indefinitely for datasets
  with frequent appends and removes.
- [deleted] segments are removed from the index
- [archive age] segments are repacked if needed, then moved to .archive/last
- [delete age] segments are deleted


## Check and repack on dir segments

### During check

- the segment must exist [deleted]

- find data files now known by the index [new]
- find segments that can only contain data older than `archive age` days [archive_age]
- find segments that can only contain data older than `delete age` days [delete_age]
- the segment name must represent an interval matching the dataset step
  (FIXME: should this be disabled for archives, to deal with datasets that had
  a change of step in their lifetime?) [corrupted]
- the segment must be a directory [unaligned]
- the size of each data file must match the data size exactly [corrupted]
- data on disk must match the order of data used by queries [dirty]
- `.metadata` file must not be empty [unaligned]
- `.metadata` file must not be older than the data [unaligned]
- `.summary` file must not be older than the `.metadata` file [unaligned]
- `MANIFEST` file must not be older than the `.metadata` file [unaligned]
- metadata in the `.metadata` file must contain reference time elements [corrupted]
- the span of reference times in each segment must fit inside the interval
  implied by the segment file name (FIXME: should this be disabled for
  archives, to deal with datasets that had a change of step in their lifetime?) [corrupted]
