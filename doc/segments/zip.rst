zip segments
============

zip segments are like dir segments (see :ref:`segments-dir`) stored inside a
zip file.

The dataset is compressed, but because zip archives compress each file
individually, it is only effective when each data stored is reasonably big,
like in the case of GRIB or ODIMH5 data.
