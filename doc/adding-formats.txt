Adding support for new data formats
===================================

Arkimet is designed to be as much format agnostic as possible. Format-specific
code is only used for metadata extraction and (optionally) for consistency
checks of archived data; everywhere else the data to archive is treated like
opaque bitstrings.

Code for metadata extraction is found in arki/scan/ and accessed via
arki/scan/any.h, which provide general, format-independent, scanning and
validation functions.

The only medatata that is always required from a metadata scan is the reference
time. Everything else is optional, although the more can be extracted, the more
it will be possible to create useful queries to extract the data.

To implement support for a new data format, just add a new module in arki/scan/
and wire it into arki/scan/any.cc. You can use arki/scan/grib and
arki/scan/bufr as examples.

arki/scan/grib uses Lua to make the scanning process configurable, because GRIB
files are extremely diverse. Using Lua is however a choice of the GRIB scanner:
it is not required that all scanners use Lua. The idea is that, while it would
be good to try to maintain some consistency if possible, every scanner is free
to do whatever works best for the data format that needs to be scanned.

arki/scan/odimh5 files allow to scan OdimH5 Polar volumes (object=PVOL)
with SCAN datasets (product=SCAN). Support for new type of products can be
added.
