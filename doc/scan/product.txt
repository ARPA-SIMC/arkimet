 * GRIB1

Scanned as GRIB1(centre, gribTablesVersionNo, indicatorOfParameter)


 * GRIB2

Scanned as GRIB2(centre, discipline, parameterCategory, parameterNumber)


 * BUFR

Scanned as BUFR(type, subtype, localsubtype)

If DB-All.e can identify the message type, it is instead scanned as:
BUFR(type, subtype, localsubtype, t=type)

If DB-All.e can provide a physical interpretation of the message data, then
in some cases extra key=value pairs are added to the product definition:

 - for 'pollution' messages, "p=<polltype>" is added to represent the type of
   pollutant measured in the message. <polltype> is one of the codes defined at
   the top of /etc/arkimet/scan-bufr/pollution.lua
