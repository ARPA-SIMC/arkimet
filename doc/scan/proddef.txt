 * GRIB1

Product defintions are only scanned when there is a localDefinitionNumber value
set. In that case, they are scanned as:

  GRIB(ld=localDefinitionNumber, mt=marsType, nn=<see below>)

The value of nn is either perturbationNumber, forecastProbabilityNumber or
clusterNumber, according to which one is set. If more than one are set, then
the order of preference is as the names appear above; that is,
perturbationNumber has priority over forecastProbabilityNumber and so on.


 * GRIB2

Product definitions are only scanned when typeOfProcessedData is 3, 4 or 5.
In that case, they are scanneda s:

  GRIB(mc=marsClass, mt=marsType, ty=typeOfEnsembleForecast,
       pf=perturbationNumber, tf=numberOfForecastsInEnsemble,
       d=derivedForecast)

d=derivedForecast may be missing if it was missing in the GRIB message.


 * BUFR

For all supported types except pollution and ship, proddef is scanned as:

  GRIB(blo=block, sta=station, id=ident)

Any of blo, sta or id can be missing if they are missing in the BUFR message.


For pollution messages, proddef is scanned as before, but with two extra data:

  GRIB(blo=block, sta=station, id=ident, gems=B01214, name=B01019)

As before, also gems and name can be missing if they are missing in the BUFR
message.
