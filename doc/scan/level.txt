 * GRIB1

Levels are scanned as GRIB1(indicatorOfTypeOfLevel, level)

Layers are scanned as GRIB1(indicatorOfTypeOfLevel, topLevel, bottomLevel)


 * GRIB2

Levels are scanned as GRIB2S(typeOfFirstFixedSurface,
                             scaleFactorOfFirstFixedSurface,
                             scaledValueOfFirstFixedSurface)

Layers are scanned as GRIB2D(typeOfFirstFixedSurface,
                             scaleFactorOfFirstFixedSurface,
                             scaledValueOfFirstFixedSurface,
                             typeOfSecondFixedSurface,

                             scaledValueOfSecondFixedSurface)

If the scaleFactor for a surface is -1, both the scaleFactor and the
corresponding scaledValue are set to 0.


 * BUFR

Levels are not scanned for BUFR messages.
