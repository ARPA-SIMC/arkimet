 * GRIB1

Timeranges are scanned as:

   GRIB1(timeRangeIndicator, P1, P2)

indicatorOfUnitOfTimeRange is used for the measurement unit of P1 and P2.


For COSMO GRIBs with timeRangeIndicator=13, Timeranges are instead scanned
using Timedefs. Since their timerange definition depends on the product type,
their meaning can only be determined at scan time, when all the GRIB contents
are available.

COSMO GRIB scanning works as such:

 - for instantaneous data (P1 = P2 = 0): Timedef(0s,254,0s)
 - otherwise: Timedef(0s, <see below>, P2-P1<indicatorOfUnitOfTimeRange>)

The type of statistical processing is inferred through a table lookup based on
gribTablesVersionNo and indicatorOfParameter.


 * GRIB2

For analyses, Timeranges are scanned as:

   Timedef(forecastTime<indicatorOfUnitOfTimeRange>, 254, 0s)

For forecasts, Timeranges are scanned as:

   Timedef(forecastTime + lengthOfTimeRange <indicatorOfUnitOfTimeRange>,
           typeOfStatisticalProcessing,
            lengthOfTimeRange<indicatorOfUnitOfTimeRange>)

   or, when statistical processing information is not available:

   Timedef(forecastTime<indicatorOfUnitOfTimeRange>)

For forecasts when productDefinitionTemplateNumber=8 and typeOfProcessedData=0,
they are scanned as:

   Timedef(0s, typeOfStatisticalProcessing, lengthOfTimeRange<indicatorOfUnitOfTimeRange>)

   or, when statistical processing information is not available:

   Timedef(0s)


 * BUFR

Timeranges are only scanned for BUFR messages which contain forecast data. At
the moment this happens only for local uses.

Timedef timeranges are used to store the forecast time only: no statistical
process information is retained.

The contents of the BUFR message are scanned after interpretation by DB-All.e,
taking note of all P1 values for data with pindicator!=254. If all P1 values
are the same, they are used as the forecast step in seconds.

Timeranges are then scanned as:

   Timedef(<forecast step><unit>)

where the forecast step is represented as second, minute or hour according to
the largest unit that can be used without loss of information.
