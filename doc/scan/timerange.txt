 * GRIB1

Timeranges are scanned as:

   GRIB1(timeRangeIndicator, P1, P2)

indicatorOfUnitOfTimeRange is used for the measurement unit of P1 and P2.


For COSMO GRIBs with timeRangeIndicator=13, Timeranges are instead scanned
using Timedefs. Since their timerange definition depends on the product type,
their meaning can only be determined at scan time, when all the GRIB contents
are available.

COSMO GRIB scanning works as such:

 - for instantaneous data (P1 = P2 = 0): Timedef(0s,254,0s)
 - otherwise: Timedef(0s, <see below>, P2-P1<indicatorOfUnitOfTimeRange>)

The type of statistical processing is inferred through a table lookup based on
gribTablesVersionNo and indicatorOfParameter.


 * GRIB2

For analyses, Timeranges are scanned as:

   Timedef(forecastTime<indicatorOfUnitOfTimeRange>, 254, 0s)

For forecasts, Timeranges are scanned as:

   Timedef(forecastTime + lengthOfTimeRange <indicatorOfUnitOfTimeRange>,
           typeOfStatisticalProcessing,
            lengthOfTimeRange<indicatorOfUnitOfTimeRange>)

   or, when statistical processing information is not available:

   Timedef(forecastTime<indicatorOfUnitOfTimeRange>)

For forecasts when productDefinitionTemplateNumber=8 and typeOfProcessedData=0,
they are scanned as:

   Timedef(0s, typeOfStatisticalProcessing, lengthOfTimeRange<indicatorOfUnitOfTimeRange>)

   or, when statistical processing information is not available:

   Timedef(0s)


 * BUFR

Timeranges are only scanned for BUFR messages which contain forecast data. At
the moment this happens only for local uses.

Timedef timeranges are used to store the forecast time only: no statistical
process information is retained.

The contents of the BUFR message are scanned after interpretation by DB-All.e,
taking note of all P1 values for data with pindicator!=254. If all P1 values
are the same, they are used as the forecast step in seconds.

Timeranges are then scanned as:

   Timedef(<forecast step><unit>)

where the forecast step is represented as second, minute or hour according to
the largest unit that can be used without loss of information.


 * Example timerange matches

A Timedef timerange is as such:

    timerange: Timedef, forecastStep, procType, procLen

- forecastStep is the time elapsed from the reference time:
  for analysis, forecastStep=0;
  for instantaneous forecasts, forecastStep is the forecast time;
  for processed forecasts, forecastStep refers to the end of the processing interval.

- procType is the type of statistical processing:
  for instantaneous data, procType=254;
  for processed data, procType is defined according to WMO GRIB2 table 4.10 (0=average, 1=accumulation, 2=maximum, etc.).

- procLen is the length of time over which the statistical processing is done;
  for instantaneous data, procLen=0

- The time unit for forecastStep and procLen is specified as a suffix (s, m, h, d, mo, y);
  a value of 0 can be used without suffix;
  an expression can contain different suffixes, but mo (month) can not be mixed with other suffixes.

- Any of forecastStep, proctype and proclen can be omitted: if so, any value will match;
  an hyphen (-) matches a missing value.

- For processsed analysis, the "reference time" is usually the beginning of processing interval;
  only for Grib 1 with timeRangeIndicator=13 is it the end of the processing interval.

Examples:
Timedef,0,254    instantaneous analysis
Timedef,6h,254   +6h instantaneous forecasts
Timedef,6h,1,6h  forecasts accumulated from +0 to +6h

Timedef,,254     all instantaneous products (analysis or forecasts)
Timedef,24h,1    all forecasts whose accumulation period ends at +24h
Timedef,,1,6h    all products accumulated over a 6h interval (analysis or forecasts)


For GRIB1, an alternative syntax can be used:

    timerange: GRIB1, type, P1, P2

- type is the "time range indicator", defined according to WMO code table 5 (0=instantaneous, 3=average, 4=accumulation, etc.)

- P1 and P2 are the time periods, and their significance depends on the value of "type"
